#READ BEORE DOING ANYTHING!!!!

Including a lot of pictures I made for the first time. I never edited or made anything like this before. All the Source files are in .sourcefiles and so are the corresponding pictures with it. There is also a portfolio website with most of the graphic design stuff I did in different cities. To open it, download the repo and run the website on a code editor like VS Code or something.

 ALL PHOTOS AND PNGS ARE USING CANVA PRO, WORDPRESS, AND OTHER EDITORS, WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY IMAGES, AND GRAPHICS. ALSO EVERYTHING IN THESE POSTERS/GRAPHIC DESIGNS IS HANDMADE, AND COMPLETELY ORIGINAL, FROM THE TEXT TO THE IMAGES. THEN, THE IMAGES ARE EXPORTED IN THE HIGHEST QUALITY, ALONGSIDE WITH THE SOURCE FILES. 

 before asking if each design took an hour to make, every element, text, graphic, and image had to be put in from the start, and then later config the graphic designs/photos and exported them, which easily takes that timeframe. I noticed that I had a couple mistakes in not putting the source file but I did, which also took some time, but not as much as creating the actual thing.
